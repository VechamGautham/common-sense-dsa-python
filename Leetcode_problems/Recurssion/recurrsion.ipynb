    "To solve `print_1_n(n)` using recursion, first understand the **subproblem inside the main problem**.\n",

    "So the subproblem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Print numbers from 1 to (n−1).”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we use recursion:  \n",
    "we call `print_1_n(n-1)` to let the function handle the smaller version of the problem first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion keeps reducing `n` until it reaches the **base case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "n == 0\n",
    "\n",
    "At `print_1_n(1-1)`, which is `print_1_n(0)`, the function returns without printing anything.  \n",
    "This stops the recursive chain from going deeper.\n",
    "\n",

    "To solve the digit-counting problem using recursion, you first introduce a parameter that keeps track of how many digits have been counted so far. This is why the function uses an `index` parameter that starts from 1. On each recursive call, you remove the last digit of the number using integer division by 10 and increment the index by 1. Conceptually, for a number like 1234567890, each step strips one digit from the right and increases the count of digits processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is when the number is reduced to 1. At this point, you have reached the final single digit, so you return the current value of `index`. That `index` now represents the total number of digits encountered along the recursive path. However, returning the index only at the base case is not enough; you must ensure that this result is passed all the way back through every previous recursive call. That is why you write `return count_digits(n // 10, index + 1)` instead of just calling `count_digits(...)` without returning it. The `return` keyword makes each call hand back the same final index value it received from deeper recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not use `return` in front of the recursive call, then only the deepest call (when the number becomes 1) actually returns a proper value, while all earlier calls ignore that value and themselves return `None`. As a result, the original call on something like 1234567890 would give `None` instead of the correct digit count. You can think of the whole process as a chain: `count_digits(123)` calls `count_digits(12)`, which calls `count_digits(1)`, which returns an index of 3. That 3 then bubbles back unchanged through each previous call because of the `return` keyword, and eventually becomes the final answer for the original input."
