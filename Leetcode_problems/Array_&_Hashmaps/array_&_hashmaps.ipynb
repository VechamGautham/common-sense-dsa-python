    "The goal of the problem is to find two numbers in a list that add up to a given target. We are required to return the **indices** of these two numbers, and we cannot use the **same index twice**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, we loop through the list using `enumerate(nums)`, which gives both the index and the value (`index`, `num`) at the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we check if this `diff` is already present in the HashMap. If it is, that means we have already seen a number earlier in the list that can be paired with the current number to reach the target. Since the HashMap stores the index of that number, we simply return `[seen[diff], index]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `diff` is not found in the HashMap, we store the current number and its index in the map using `seen[num] = i`. This way, it will be available for future iterations if needed as someone else‚Äôs complement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since HashMaps only store unique keys, we don‚Äôt have to worry if a key‚Äôs index gets updated. In the end, we just need the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. As long as that condition is satisfied, we‚Äôre good to go\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, the HashMap is empty, so it keeps filling up as we move through the array. The loop continues until the required pair is found and returned.\n",
