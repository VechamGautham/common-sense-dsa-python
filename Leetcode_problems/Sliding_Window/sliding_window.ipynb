    "## 🧠 Problem: Max Sum of Four Consecutive Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the **maximum sum** of any **four consecutive integers** in a given list of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Approach: Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to solve this problem is by using the **sliding window technique** instead of brute-force.  \n",
    "While brute-force would involve nested loops and multiple repeated sum calculations, sliding window allows us to **optimize** it using a constant-time update.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, compute the sum of the first **4 elements** (index 0 to 3).  \n",
    "- This is your **initial window**, and the result is stored in a variable called `current_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set `max_sum_so_far = current_sum` because that's our best sum found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, begin iterating from index 4 to the end of the list.  \n",
    "  For every new element:\n",
    "  - Add the new number that enters the window (at index `i`)\n",
    "  - Subtract the number that just left the window (at index `i - 4`)\n",
    "  - Update `max_sum_so_far` if the current sum is greater\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why Sliding Window?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say your current window is from index `i-4` to `i-1`.  \n",
    "To slide it one step right:\n",
    "- Remove the first element in the current window (at index `i - 4`)\n",
    "- Add the new element coming into the window (at index `i`)\n",
    "- The other elements stay unchanged, so you don't need to recompute the entire sum — just update with addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the repeated calculations done in brute-force.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔢 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:  \n",
    "`nums = [1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4, 1, 8, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- First 4 elements → `[1, 3, 2, 6]` → sum = 12  \n",
    "- Next window → `[3, 2, 6, 1]` → sum = 12  \n",
    "- Then → `[2, 6, 1, 4]` → sum = 13  \n",
    "- Then → `[6, 1, 4, 1]` → sum = 12  \n",
    "- Then → `[1, 4, 1, 8]` → sum = 14  \n",
    "- Then → `[4, 1, 8, 2]` → sum = 15  \n",

    "\n",
    "The main goal of this problem is to find the maximum number of **vowels** in any **substring of length `k`** within a given string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're provided with:\n",

    "- An integer `k` representing the length of the substring\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine **which substring of length `k`** contains the **maximum number of vowels**, and return that maximum count.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Optimal Approach: Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this efficiently, we use the **Sliding Window Technique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 Step-by-Step Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Two Variables**:\n",
    "   - `currentCount`: This keeps track of the number of vowels in the current sliding window of length `k`.\n",
    "   - `maxVowelsSoFar`: This tracks the highest number of vowels seen so far in any substring of length `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vowel Storage**:\n",
    "   - Create a list or set containing all the vowels: `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`.\n",
    "   - This is used to quickly check if a character is a vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First Window Setup**:\n",
    "   - Use a loop to go through the **first `k`  characters** of the string.\n",
    "   - For each character, check if it's a vowel.\n",
    "     - If yes, increment `currentCount`.\n",
    "   - After this loop, set `maxVowelsSoFar` equal to `currentCount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sliding the Window**:\n",
    "   - Now start another loop from index `k. (range(k,len(s)))` to the end of the string.\n",
    "   - For each step:\n",
    "     - You're moving the window one character to the right.\n",
    "     - So, you must:\n",
    "       - **Remove** the effect of the character that is moving **out** of the window (i.e., at index `i - k`)\n",
    "       - **Add** the effect of the new character that is **entering** the window (i.e., at index `i`)\n",
    "     - Check:\n",
    "       - If the outgoing character is a vowel, decrement `currentCount`.\n",
    "       - If the incoming character is a vowel, increment `currentCount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Maximum**:\n",
    "   - After adjusting `currentCount` in each step, compare it with `maxVowelsSoFar`.\n",
    "   - If `currentCount` is greater, update `maxVowelsSoFar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - After the loop ends, return `maxVowelsSoFar` which holds the highest number of vowels seen in any window of length `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Sliding Window Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this approach works so efficiently is that we don't re-check the entire substring each time — we only adjust the count based on the character leaving and entering the window.  \n",
    "This makes the solution **linear in time** with respect to the length of the string, i.e., **O(n)** time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a single number — the **maximum number of vowels** in any substring of size `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",

    "Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this problem is to find the maximum average among all subarrays of length k within the given array nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re provided with:\n",
    "\t•\tAn integer array nums\n",
    "\t•\tAn integer k representing the subarray length\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine which subarray of length k has the maximum sum, and return its average.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Approach: Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, we use the Sliding Window Technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we are dealing with a fixed-size subarray (length k) and we want to efficiently compute the sum as the window slides through the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-Step Logic\n",
    "\t1.\tInitialize the First Window:\n",
    "\t•\tCompute the sum of the first k elements.\n",
    "\t•\tStore it in a variable called currentSum.\n",
    "\t•\tAlso initialize maxSumSoFar with the same value.\n",
    "\t2.\tWhy Not Initialize to 0?:\n",
    "\t•\tWe avoid initializing to 0 because the array can contain negative numbers.\n",
    "\t•\tStarting from 0 would be incorrect since 0 is greater than all negative sums.\n",
    "\t3.\tSliding the Window:\n",
    "\t•\tStart a loop from index k to the end of the array (i.e., range(k, len(nums))).\n",
    "\t•\tFor each step:\n",
    "\t•\tSubtract the element that’s moving out of the window: nums[i - k]\n",
    "\t•\tAdd the new element that’s coming in: nums[i]\n",
    "\t•\tUpdate currentSum using these two operations.\n",
    "\t•\tThis allows us to keep the sum updated without recomputing it from scratch.\n",
    "\t4.\tUpdate Maximum Sum:\n",
    "\t•\tAt each step, compare currentSum with maxSumSoFar.\n",
    "\t•\tIf currentSum is greater, update maxSumSoFar.\n",
    "\t5.\tReturn the Final Average:\n",
    "\t•\tAfter the loop, return maxSumSoFar / k.\n",
    "\t•\tUse floating-point division to get decimal precision like 12.75 instead of 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding Window Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this approach is efficient is that we don’t have to re-add the entire subarray every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we:\n",
    "\t•\tRemove the first value (left-most)\n",
    "\t•\tAdd the next value (right-most)\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the updated sum in O(1) time per step.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a floating-point number representing the maximum average of any subarray of size k.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "\t•\tTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array\n",
    "\t•\tSpace Complexity: O(1), since we use only a few variables\n",
