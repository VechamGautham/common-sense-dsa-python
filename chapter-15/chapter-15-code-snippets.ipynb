    "If we want our data in an **alphabetized list** or in an **order from lowest to highest**, we usually sort it using a sorting algorithm. The most optimized one, **quicksort**, takes around **O(n log n)** time in the average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one good option is to **store the data in an ordered way**. This is better for **searching or reading**. However, when it comes to **insertion and deletion**, the worst-case scenario in a sorted array would take **O(n)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might consider using a **hashmap**, which provides fast access, but hashmaps are **not stored in an ordered way**.\n",

    "Unlike a linked list, where each node connects to only one next node, in a BST each node can connect to **multiple nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **uppermost node** is called the **root**.\n",
    "- For example, if `J` is connected to `M` and `B`, we say:\n",
    "  - `J` is the **parent** of `M` and `B`\n",
    "  - `M` and `B` are the **children** of `J`\n",
    "- Similarly, if `M` has children `Q` and `Z`, then:\n",

    "First, you start with any node — typically the root node — to get the nodes in **alphabetical order**. To do that, you define a function called `traverse_and_print(node)`. This function takes a node and performs the inorder traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step inside the function is to check whether the node exists. This is the **base case** for recursion. If the node is `None`, it simply returns — meaning the recursion stops from there.\n",

    "Initially, the root node `\"Moby Dick\"` is passed to the function. But before the function finishes executing, the left child of `\"Moby Dick\"` is called recursively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then it checks for the right child — since that also doesn’t exist, the function ends here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we check the stack to see which function call was waiting to complete.\n",
