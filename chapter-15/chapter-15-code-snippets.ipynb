    "So, one good option is to **store the data in an ordered way**. This is better for **searching or reading**. However, when it comes to **insertion and deletion**, the worst-case scenario in a sorted array would take **O(n)** time.\n",

    "We might consider using a **hashmap**, which provides fast access, but hashmaps are **not stored in an ordered way**.\n",
